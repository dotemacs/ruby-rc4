== RC4

RC4 is a pure Ruby implementation of the Rc4 algorithm.


== Usage

First require the gem:

    require 'rc4' 

To encrypt:

    key = "nuff rspec"
    enc = RC4.new(key)
    encrypted = enc.encrypt("super-cool-test")

To decrypt:

    dec = RC4.new(key)
    decrypted = dec.decrypt(encrypted)

Since encrypt method is used for encryption and decryption, decrypt is
just an alias to encrypt in order to make the usage more intuitive.

== Note

The original algorithm implementation in Ruby by Max Prokopiev
<max-prokopiev@yandex.ru>.

I have then modified it to suit my needs, wrote test suite and gem
packaged it using gem-this.
