== RubyRc4

RubyRc4 is a pure Ruby implementation of the Rc4 algorithm.

== Using

First, construct two new instances of RubyRc4 class:

  encryptor = RubyRc4.new('mysecret_key')
  decryptor = RubyRc4.new('mysecret_key')

And encrypt any string you want:

  encrypted_data = encryptor.encrypt('secret_data')
  
Or decrypt it:

  plain_text = decryptor.encrypt(encrypted_data)
  
Finally, you can check equality if you want:

  plain_text.eql?('secret_data')
